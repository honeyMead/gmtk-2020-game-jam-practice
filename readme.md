# Feathery Inferno

🔥🐔 Unity 2D game where you control the chosen chicken 🐔🔥

## GMTK 2020 Game Jam Practice

To prepare myself for the [GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022) I create games with previous themes.

2020's theme was: "**Out of control**".

## Game idea

* A phoenix god gives a chicken fire abilities.
* The player controls the fire chicken.
* It has to free other chickens.
* It can not fully understand its new powers, so the fires it creates are out of control.
* On its way it burns stuff down by accident. E.g. wooden bridges.
* To create interesting puzzles, other stuff like stones will not burn.
* The chickens to rescue move also out of control, but away from fires.
* Normal chickens survive only one round in flames. Water places in levels put out fire.
* Turn-based gameplay. Step-after-step: everytime you move one tile, the fires and chickens also move.
* Moveable items or level blocks.

### Rules

* Fires only spread to non-diagonal neighbor fields.
* Once a chicken was next to a fire, it runs to the exit.
* When a chicken stands two rounds next to a fire, it starts to burn.
